## DESCRIPTION
       The  cmake  executable is the command-line interface of the cross-plat‐
       form buildsystem generator CMake.  The above Synopsis lists various ac‐
       tions the tool can perform as described in sections below.

       To build a software project with CMake, Generate a Project Buildsystem.
       Optionally use cmake to Build a Project, Install a Project or just  run
       the  corresponding  build tool (e.g. make) directly.  cmake can also be
       used to View Help.

       The other actions are meant for  use  by  software  developers  writing
       scripts in the CMake language to support their builds.

       For graphical user interfaces that may be used in place of cmake, see ‐
       ccmake and cmake-gui.  For command-line interfaces to the CMake testing
       and packaging facilities, see ctest and cpack.

       For  more  information on CMake at large, see also the links at the end
       of this manual.

INTRODUCTION TO CMAKE BUILDSYSTEMS
       A buildsystem describes how to build a project's  executables  and  li‐
       braries  from  its  source  code  using  a  build  tool to automate the
       process.  For example, a buildsystem may be a Makefile for use  with  a
       command-line  make tool or a project file for an Integrated Development
       Environment  (IDE).   In  order  to  avoid  maintaining  multiple  such
       buildsystems,  a  project  may specify its buildsystem abstractly using
       files written in the CMake language.  From these files CMake  generates
       a  preferred buildsystem locally for each user through a backend called
       a generator.

       To generate a buildsystem with CMake, the following must be selected:

       Source Tree
              The top-level directory containing source files provided by  the
              project.   The  project specifies its buildsystem using files as
              described in  the  cmake-language(7)  manual,  starting  with  a
              top-level  file named CMakeLists.txt.  These files specify build
              targets  and  their  dependencies  as   described   in   the   ‐
              cmake-buildsystem(7) manual.

       Build Tree
              The  top-level  directory  in  which buildsystem files and build
              output artifacts (e.g. executables  and  libraries)  are  to  be
              stored.   CMake will write a CMakeCache.txt file to identify the
              directory as a build tree and store persistent information  such
              as buildsystem configuration options.

              To  maintain  a  pristine  source tree, perform an out-of-source
              build by using a separate dedicated build  tree.   An  in-source
              build in which the build tree is placed in the same directory as
              the source tree is also supported, but discouraged.

       Generator
              This  chooses  the  kind  of buildsystem to generate.  See the ‐
              cmake-generators(7) manual for documentation of all  generators.
              Run  cmake --help to see a list of generators available locally.
              Optionally use the -G option below to specify  a  generator,  or
              simply  accept  the  default CMake chooses for the current plat‐
              form.

              When using one of the Command-Line Build Tool  Generators  CMake
              expects that the environment needed by the compiler toolchain is
              already  configured  in  the  shell.   When using one of the IDE
              Build Tool Generators, no particular environment is needed.

GENERATE A PROJECT BUILDSYSTEM
       Run CMake with one of the following command signatures to  specify  the
       source and build trees and generate a buildsystem:

       cmake [<options>] -B <path-to-build> [-S <path-to-source>]
          Added in version 3.13.

          Uses  <path-to-build>  as the build tree and <path-to-source> as the
          source tree.  The specified paths may be absolute or relative to the
          current working directory.  The source tree must  contain  a  CMake‐
          Lists.txt  file.  The build tree will be created automatically if it
          does not already exist.  For example:

              $ cmake -S src -B build

       cmake [<options>] <path-to-source>
              Uses the current  working  directory  as  the  build  tree,  and
              <path-to-source>  as the source tree.  The specified path may be
              absolute or relative to  the  current  working  directory.   The
              source tree must contain a CMakeLists.txt file and must not con‐
              tain  a CMakeCache.txt file because the latter identifies an ex‐
              isting build tree.  For example:

                 $ mkdir build ; cd build
                 $ cmake ../src

       cmake [<options>] <path-to-existing-build>
              Uses <path-to-existing-build> as the build tree, and  loads  the
              path to the source tree from its CMakeCache.txt file, which must
              have  already  been  generated  by a previous run of CMake.  The
              specified path may be absolute or relative to the current  work‐
              ing directory.  For example:

                 $ cd build
                 $ cmake .

       In all cases the <options> may be zero or more of the Options below.

       The  above  styles  for  specifying  the  source and build trees may be
       mixed.  Paths specified with -S or -B are always classified  as  source
       or build trees, respectively.  Paths specified with plain arguments are
       classified based on their content and the types of paths given earlier.
       If  only one type of path is given, the current working directory (cwd)
       is used for the other.  For example:
                  ┌─────────────────────┬────────────┬───────────┐
                  │ Command Line        │ Source Dir │ Build Dir │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake -B build      │ cwd        │ build     │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake -B build src  │ src        │ build     │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake -B  build  -S │ src        │ build     │
                  │ src                 │            │           │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake src           │ src        │ cwd       │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake build (exist‐ │ loaded     │ build     │
                  │ ing)                │            │           │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake -S src        │ src        │ cwd       │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake -S src build  │ src        │ build     │
                  ├─────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
                  │ cmake   -S  src  -B │ src        │ build     │
                  │ build               │            │           │
                  └─────────────────────┴────────────┴───────────┘

       Changed in version 3.23: CMake warns when  multiple  source  paths  are
       specified.  This has never been officially documented or supported, but
       older versions accidentally accepted multiple source paths and used the
       last path specified.  Avoid passing multiple source path arguments.

       After  generating  a  buildsystem  one may use the corresponding native
       build tool to build the project.  For example,  after  using  the  Unix
       Makefiles generator one may run make directly:

              $ make
              $ make install

       Alternatively,  one  may  use cmake to Build a Project by automatically
       choosing and invoking the appropriate native build tool.

   Options
       -S <path-to-source>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       -B <path-to-build>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build  di‐
              rectory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       -C <initial-cache>
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When  CMake  is  first  run in an empty build tree, it creates a
              CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable  settings
              for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from
              which  to  load  cache entries before the first pass through the
              project's CMake listfiles.  The  loaded  entries  take  priority
              over  the  project's default values.  The given file should be a
              CMake script containing set() commands that use  the  CACHE  op‐
              tion, not a cache-format file.

              References  to  CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR within the
              script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree.

       -D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>
              Create or update a CMake CACHE entry.

              When CMake is first run in an empty build  tree,  it  creates  a
              CMakeCache.txt  file and populates it with customizable settings
              for the project.  This option may be used to specify  a  setting
              that  takes  priority over the project's default value.  The op‐
              tion may be repeated for as many CACHE entries as desired.

              If the :<type> portion is given it must  be  one  of  the  types
              specified  by the set() command documentation for its CACHE sig‐
              nature.  If the :<type> portion is omitted  the  entry  will  be
              created  with  no type if it does not exist with a type already.
              If a command in the project sets the type to  PATH  or  FILEPATH
              then the <value> will be converted to an absolute path.

              This   option   may   also   be  given  as  a  single  argument:
              -D<var>:<type>=<value> or -D<var>=<value>.

              It's important to note that the order of -C and -D arguments  is
              significant.  They  will  be  carried  out in the order they are
              listed, with the last argument taking precedence over the previ‐
              ous ones. For example, if you specify  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug,
              followed by a -C argument with a file that calls:

                 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

              then  the -C argument will take precedence, and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
              will be set to Release. However, if the -D argument comes  after
              the -C argument, it will be set to Debug.

              If  a set(... CACHE ...) call in the -C file does not use FORCE,
              and a -D argument sets the same variable, the -D  argument  will
              take  precedence  regardless  of  order because of the nature of
              non-FORCE set(... CACHE ...) calls.

       -U <globbing_expr>
              Remove matching entries from CMake CACHE.

              This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
              CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are sup‐
              ported.  The option may be repeated for as many CACHE entries as
              desired.

              Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.

       -G <generator-name>
              Specify a build system generator.

              CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain plat‐
              forms.  A generator is responsible for generating  a  particular
              build  system.   Possible generator names are specified in the ‐
              cmake-generators(7) manual.

              If not specified, CMake checks the  CMAKE_GENERATOR  environment
              variable  and  otherwise  falls back to a builtin default selec‐
              tion.

       -T <toolset-spec>
              Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

              Some CMake generators support a toolset  specification  to  tell
              the  native  build  system  how to choose a compiler.  See the ‐
              CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET variable for details.

       -A <platform-name>
              Specify platform name if supported by generator.

              Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
              native build system to choose a compiler  or  SDK.   See  the  ‐
              CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM variable for details.

       --toolchain <path-to-file>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify  the  cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to set‐
              ting CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable. Relative  paths  are  inter‐
              preted  as  relative  to  the build directory, and if not found,
              relative to the source directory.

       --install-prefix <directory>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify   the   installation   directory,   used   by   the    ‐
              CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable. Must be an absolute path.

       -Wno-dev
              Suppress developer warnings.

              Suppress  warnings  that  are meant for the author of the CMake‐
              Lists.txt files. By default this will also turn off  deprecation
              warnings.

       -Wdev  Enable developer warnings.

              Enable  warnings  that  are  meant  for the author of the CMake‐
              Lists.txt files. By default this will also turn  on  deprecation
              warnings.

       -Wdeprecated
              Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

              Enable  warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are
              meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

       -Wno-deprecated
              Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

              Suppress warnings for usage of  deprecated  functionality,  that
              are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

       -Werror=<what>
              Treat  CMake  warnings as errors. <what> must be one of the fol‐
              lowing:

              dev    Make developer warnings errors.

                     Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMake‐
                     Lists.txt files errors. By default this will also turn on
                     deprecated warnings as errors.

              deprecated
                     Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated  macros  and  func‐
                     tions,  that  are  meant  for  the  author  of the CMake‐
                     Lists.txt files, errors.

       -Wno-error=<what>
              Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. <what> must be one of the
              following:

              dev    Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMake‐
                     Lists.txt files not errors. By  default  this  will  also
                     turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

              deprecated
                     Make  warnings  for  usage of deprecated macros and func‐
                     tions, that are  meant  for  the  author  of  the  CMake‐
                     Lists.txt files, not errors.

       --fresh
              Added in version 3.24.

              Perform  a  fresh configuration of the build tree.  This removes
              any existing CMakeCache.txt file and associated CMakeFiles/  di‐
              rectory, and recreates them from scratch.

              Changed  in  version 3.30: For dependencies previously populated
              by FetchContent with the NEW setting for policy  CMP0168,  their
              stamp  and  script  files from any previous run will be removed.
              The download, update, and patch steps will therefore  be  forced
              to re-execute.

       -L[A][H]
              List non-advanced cached variables.

              List  CACHE  variables will run CMake and list all the variables
              from the CMake CACHE that  are  not  marked  as  INTERNAL  or  ‐
              ADVANCED.  This will effectively display current CMake settings,
              which  can then be changed with -D option.  Changing some of the
              variables may result in more variables being created.  If  A  is
              specified,  then  it will display also advanced variables.  If H
              is specified, it will also display help for each variable.

       -LR[A][H] <regex>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Show specific non-advanced cached variables

              Show non-INTERNAL nor ADVANCED variables from  the  CMake  CACHE
              that match the given regex. If A is specified, then it will also
              show  advanced  variables.  If H is specified, it will also dis‐
              play help for each variable.

       -N     View mode only.

              Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate
              steps.

       --graphviz=<file>
              Generate graphviz of dependencies, see CMakeGraphVizOptions  for
              more.

              Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library
              and  executable dependencies in the project.  See the documenta‐
              tion for CMakeGraphVizOptions for more details.

       --system-information [file]
              Dump information about this system.

              Dump a wide range of information about the current  system.   If
              run  from  the  top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will
              dump additional information such as the cache, log files etc.

       --print-config-dir
              Added in version 3.31.

              Print CMake config directory for user-wide FileAPI queries.

              See CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR for more details.

       --log-level=<level>
              Added in version 3.16.

              Set the log <level>.

              The message() command will only output messages of the specified
              log level or higher.  The valid log levels are  ERROR,  WARNING,
              NOTICE, STATUS (default), VERBOSE, DEBUG, or TRACE.

              To   make  a  log  level  persist  between  CMake  runs,  set  ‐
              CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL as a cache variable  instead.   If  both
              the  command line option and the variable are given, the command
              line option takes precedence.

              For backward compatibility reasons, --loglevel is also  accepted
              as a synonym for this option.

              Added  in  version  3.25: See the cmake_language() command for a
              way to query the current message logging level.

       --log-context
              Enable the message() command outputting context attached to each
              message.

              This option turns on showing context for the current  CMake  run
              only.  To make showing the context persistent for all subsequent
              CMake  runs,  set CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW as a cache variable
              instead.   When  this  command   line   option   is   given,   ‐
              CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW is ignored.

       --debug-trycompile
              Do   not   delete  the  files  and  directories  created  for  ‐
              try_compile() / try_run() calls.  This is  useful  in  debugging
              failed checks.

              Note  that  some  uses  of  try_compile() may use the same build
              tree, which will limit  the  usefulness  of  this  option  if  a
              project executes more than one try_compile().  For example, such
              uses may change results as artifacts from a previous try-compile
              may  cause  a different test to either pass or fail incorrectly.
              This option is best used only when debugging.

              (With respect to the preceding, the try_run() command is  effec‐
              tively  a  try_compile().  Any combination of the two is subject
              to the potential issues described.)

              Added in version  3.25:  When  this  option  is  enabled,  every
              try-compile  check  prints a log message reporting the directory
              in which the check is performed.

       --debug-output
              Put cmake in a debug mode.

              Print extra information during the cmake run like  stack  traces
              with message(SEND_ERROR) calls.

       --debug-find
              Added in version 3.17.

              Put cmake find commands in a debug mode.

              Print  extra find call information during the cmake run to stan‐
              dard error. Output is designed for human consumption and not for
              parsing.  See also the CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE variable for debug‐
              ging a more local part of the project.

       --debug-find-pkg=<pkg>[,...]
              Added in version 3.23.

              Put cmake find commands in a debug mode when running under calls
              to find_package(<pkg>), where <pkg> is an  entry  in  the  given
              comma-separated list of case-sensitive package names.

              Like --debug-find, but limiting scope to the specified packages.

       --debug-find-var=<var>[,...]
              Added in version 3.23.

              Put  cmake  find commands in a debug mode when called with <var>
              as the result variable, where <var> is an  entry  in  the  given
              comma-separated list.

              Like  --debug-find, but limiting scope to the specified variable
              names.

       --trace
              Put cmake in trace mode.

              Print a trace of all calls made and from where.

       --trace-expand
              Put cmake in trace mode.

              Like --trace, but with variables expanded.

       --trace-format=<format>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Put cmake in trace mode and sets the trace output format.

              <format> can be one of the following values.

                 human  Prints each trace line  in  a  human-readable  format.
                        This is the default format.

                 json-v1
                        Prints  each  line  as  a separate JSON document. Each
                        document is separated by a newline ( \n ). It is guar‐
                        anteed that no newline characters will be present  in‐
                        side a JSON document.

                        The members are:

                        file   The  full  path  to the CMake source file where
                               the function was called.

                        line   The line in file where the  function  call  be‐
                               gins.

                        line_end
                               If the function call spans multiple lines, this
                               field  will  be set to the line where the func‐
                               tion call ends. If the function calls  spans  a
                               single  line,  this  field  will be unset. This
                               field was added  in  minor  version  2  of  the
                               json-v1 format.

                        defer  Optional  member that is present when the func‐
                               tion     call     was     deferred     by     ‐
                               cmake_language(DEFER).   If  present, its value
                               is a string containing the deferred call <id>.

                        cmd    The name of the function that was called.

                        args   A string list of all function parameters.

                        time   Timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the function
                               call.

                        frame  Stack frame depth  of  the  function  that  was
                               called,  within  the  context  of  the   CMake‐
                               Lists.txt being processed currently.

                        global_frame
                               Stack frame depth  of  the  function  that  was
                               called,  tracked  globally  across  all  CMake‐
                               Lists.txt files involved  in  the  trace.  This
                               field  was  added  in  minor  version  2 of the
                               json-v1 format.

                        Additionally, the first JSON document  outputted  con‐
                        tains  the version key for the current major and minor
                        version of the

                        JSON version format

                            {
                              "version": {

                                "minor": 2
                              }
                            }

                        The members are:

                        version
                               Indicates the version of the JSON  format.  The
                               version  has  a major and minor components fol‐
                               lowing semantic version conventions.

       --trace-source=<file>
              Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines  of  a  specified
              file.

              Multiple options are allowed.

       --trace-redirect=<file>
              Put  cmake in trace mode and redirect trace output to a file in‐
              stead of stderr.

       --warn-uninitialized
              Warn about uninitialized values.

              Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.

       --warn-unused-vars
              Does nothing.  In CMake versions  3.2  and  below  this  enabled
              warnings  about unused variables.  In CMake versions 3.3 through
              3.18 the option was broken.  In CMake 3.19 and above the  option
              has been removed.

       --no-warn-unused-cli
              Don't warn about command line options.

              Don't  find variables that are declared on the command line, but
              not used.

       --check-system-vars
              Find problems with variable usage in system files.

              Normally, unused and uninitialized variables  are  searched  for
              only  in CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  This flag tells
              CMake to warn about other files as well.

       --compile-no-warning-as-error
              Added in version 3.24.

              Ignore target property COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR and  variable  ‐
              CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR,  preventing  warnings from being
              treated as errors on compile.

       --profiling-output=<path>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Used in conjunction with --profiling-format to output to a given
              path.

       --profiling-format=<file>
              Enable the output of profiling data of CMake script in the given
              format.

              This can aid performance analysis  of  CMake  scripts  executed.
              Third  party  applications  should be used to process the output
              into human readable format.

              Currently supported values are: google-trace Outputs  in  Google
              Trace  Format,  which  can be parsed by the about:tracing tab of
              Google Chrome or using a plugin for a tool like Trace Compass.

       --preset <preset>, --preset=<preset>
              Reads a preset from CMakePresets.json and  CMakeUserPresets.json
              files,  which  must  be located in the same directory as the top
              level CMakeLists.txt file. The preset may specify the generator,
              the build directory, a list of variables, and other arguments to
              pass to CMake. At least one of CMakePresets.json or  CMakeUserP‐
              resets.json  must be present.  The CMake GUI also recognizes and
              supports CMakePresets.json and CMakeUserPresets.json files.  For
              full details on these files, see cmake-presets(7).

              The  presets are read before all other command line options, al‐
              though the -S option can be used to specify the source directory
              containing  the  CMakePresets.json   and   CMakeUserPresets.json
              files.   If -S is not given, the current directory is assumed to
              be the top level source directory and must contain  the  presets
              files.  The  options  specified by the chosen preset (variables,
              generator, etc.) can all be overridden  by  manually  specifying
              them  on  the  command  line.  For example, if the preset sets a
              variable called MYVAR to 1, but the user sets it to 2 with a  -D
              argument, the value 2 is preferred.

       --list-presets[=<type>]
              Lists the available presets of the specified <type>.  Valid val‐
              ues  for <type> are configure, build, test, package, or all.  If
              <type> is omitted, configure is assumed.   The  current  working
              directory  must  contain CMake preset files unless the -S option
              is used to specify a different top level source directory.

       --debugger
              Enables interactive debugging of the CMake language.  CMake  ex‐
              poses a debugging interface on the pipe named by --debugger-pipe
              that  conforms  to the Debug Adapter Protocol specification with
              the following modifications.

              The initialize  response  includes  an  additional  field  named
              cmakeVersion  which  specifies  the  version  of CMake being de‐
              bugged.

              Debugger initialize response

                 {
                   "cmakeVersion": {
                     "major": 3,
                     "minor": 27,
                     "patch": 0,
                     "full": "3.27.0"
                   }
                 }

              The members are:

              major  An integer specifying the major version number.

              minor  An integer specifying the minor version number.

              patch  An integer specifying the patch version number.

              full   A string specifying the full CMake version.

       --debugger-pipe <pipe name>, --debugger-pipe=<pipe name>
              Name of the pipe (on Windows) or domain socket (on Unix) to  use
              for debugger communication.

       --debugger-dap-log <log path>, --debugger-dap-log=<log path>
              Logs all debugger communication to the specified file.

BUILD A PROJECT
       CMake  provides  a command-line signature to build an already-generated
       project binary tree:

          cmake --build <dir>             [<options>] [-- <build-tool-options>]
          cmake --build --preset <preset> [<options>] [-- <build-tool-options>]

       This abstracts a native build tool's command-line  interface  with  the
       following options:

       --build <dir>
              Project  binary directory to be built.  This is required (unless
              a preset is specified) and must be first.

       --preset <preset>, --preset=<preset>
              Use a build preset to specify build options. The project  binary
              directory  is inferred from the configurePreset key. The current
              working directory must contain CMake preset files.   See  preset
              for more details.

       --list-presets
              Lists the available build presets. The current working directory
              must contain CMake preset files.

       -j [<jobs>], --parallel [<jobs>]
              Added in version 3.12.

              The maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building.
              If  <jobs>  is omitted the native build tool's default number is
              used.

              The CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL  environment  variable,  if  set,
              specifies  a  default  parallel  level  when  this option is not
              given.

              Some native build tools always build in parallel.   The  use  of
              <jobs> value of 1 can be used to limit to a single job.

       -t <tgt>..., --target <tgt>...
              Build <tgt> instead of the default target.  Multiple targets may
              be given, separated by spaces.

       --config <cfg>
              For multi-configuration tools, choose configuration <cfg>.

       --clean-first
              Build  target  clean  first,  then  build.   (To clean only, use
              --target clean.)

       --resolve-package-references=<value>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Resolve remote package references from external package managers
              (e.g. NuGet) before build. When <value> is set to on  (default),
              packages  will  be  restored  before  building  a  target.  When
              <value> is set to only, the packages will be  restored,  but  no
              build  will  be performed.  When <value> is set to off, no pack‐
              ages will be restored.

              If the target does not define any package references,  this  op‐
              tion does nothing.

              This  setting  can  be  specified  in  a build preset (using re‐
              solvePackageReferences). The preset setting will be ignored,  if
              this command line option is specified.

              If  no  command line parameter or preset option are provided, an
              environment- specific cache variable will be  evaluated  to  de‐
              cide, if package restoration should be performed.

              When  using  the Visual Studio generator, package references are
              defined using the VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES property. Package refer‐
              ences are restored using NuGet. It can be  disabled  by  setting
              the CMAKE_VS_NUGET_PACKAGE_RESTORE variable to OFF.

       --use-stderr
              Ignored.  Behavior is default in CMake >= 3.0.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable  verbose output - if supported - including the build com‐
              mands to be executed.

              This option can be omitted if VERBOSE environment variable or  ‐
              CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE cached variable is set.

       --     Pass remaining options to the native tool.

       Run cmake --build with no options for quick help.

INSTALL A PROJECT
       CMake provides a command-line signature to install an already-generated
       project binary tree:

          cmake --install <dir> [<options>]

       This  may  be used after building a project to run installation without
       using the generated build system or the native build tool.  The options
       are:

       --install <dir>
              Project binary directory to install. This is required  and  must
              be first.

       --config <cfg>
              For multi-configuration generators, choose configuration <cfg>.

       --component <comp>
              Component-based install. Only install component <comp>.

       --default-directory-permissions <permissions>
              Default  directory  install  permissions.  Permissions in format
              <u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx>.

       --prefix <prefix>
              Override the installation prefix, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

       --strip
              Strip before installing.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.

              This option can be omitted if VERBOSE  environment  variable  is
              set.

       -j <jobs>, --parallel <jobs>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Install  in parallel using the given number of jobs. Only avail‐
              able    if    INSTALL_PARALLEL     is     enabled.     The     ‐
              CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL  environment  variable  specifies a
              default parallel level when this option is not provided.

       Run cmake --install with no options for quick help.

OPEN A PROJECT
          cmake --open <dir>

       Open the generated project in the associated application.  This is only
       supported by some generators.

RUN A SCRIPT
          cmake [-D <var>=<value>]... -P <cmake-script-file> [-- <unparsed-options>...]

       -D <var>=<value>
              Define a variable for script mode.

       -P <cmake-script-file>
              Process the given cmake file as a script written  in  the  CMake
              language.   No  configure  or generate step is performed and the
              cache is not modified.  If variables are defined using -D,  this
              must be done before the -P argument.

       Any  options  after  -- are not parsed by CMake, but they are still in‐
       cluded in the set of CMAKE_ARGV<n> variables passed to the script  (in‐
       cluding the -- itself).

RUN A COMMAND-LINE TOOL
       CMake provides builtin command-line tools through the signature

          cmake -E <command> [<options>]

       -E [help]
              Run cmake -E or cmake -E help for a summary of commands.

       Available commands are:

       capabilities
              Added in version 3.7.

              Report  cmake  capabilities in JSON format. The output is a JSON
              object with the following keys:

              version
                     A JSON object with version information. Keys are:

                     string The full version  string  as  displayed  by  cmake
                            --version.

                     major  The major version number in integer form.

                     minor  The minor version number in integer form.

                     patch  The patch level in integer form.

                     suffix The cmake version suffix string.

                     isDirty
                            A  bool  that  is set if the cmake build is from a
                            dirty tree.

              generators
                     A list available generators. Each generator is a JSON ob‐
                     ject with the following keys:

                     name   A string containing the name of the generator.

                     toolsetSupport
                            true if the generator supports toolsets and  false
                            otherwise.

                     platformSupport
                            true if the generator supports platforms and false
                            otherwise.

                     supportedPlatforms
                            Added in version 3.21.

                            Optional  member that may be present when the gen‐
                            erator  supports  platform  specification  via   ‐
                            CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM (-A ...).  The value is a
                            list of platforms known to be supported.

                     extraGenerators
                            A  list  of  strings with all the Extra Generators
                            compatible with the generator.

              fileApi
                     Optional   member   that   is   present   when   the    ‐
                     cmake-file-api(7)  is available.  The value is a JSON ob‐
                     ject with one member:

                     requests
                            A JSON array containing  zero  or  more  supported
                            file-api  requests.  Each request is a JSON object
                            with members:

                            kind   Specifies  one  of  the  supported   Object
                                   Kinds.

                            version
                                   A JSON array whose elements are each a JSON
                                   object  containing  major and minor members
                                   specifying  non-negative  integer   version
                                   components.

              serverMode
                     true  if  cmake supports server-mode and false otherwise.
                     Always false since CMake 3.20.

              tls    Added in version 3.25.

                     true if TLS support is enabled and false otherwise.

              debugger
                     Added in version 3.27.

                     true if the --debugger mode is supported and false other‐
                     wise.

       cat [--] <files>...
              Added in version 3.18.

              Concatenate files and print on the standard output.

              --     Added in version 3.24.

                     Added support for the double dash argument --. This basic
                     implementation of cat does not support  any  options,  so
                     using  a  option starting with - will result in an error.
                     Use -- to indicate the end of options,  in  case  a  file
                     starts with -.

              Added  in  version 3.29: cat can now print the standard input by
              passing the - argument.

       chdir <dir> <cmd> [<arg>...]
              Change the current working directory and run a command.

       compare_files [--ignore-eol] <file1> <file2>
              Check if <file1> is same as <file2>. If files are the same, then
              returns 0, if not it returns 1.  In case of  invalid  arguments,
              it returns 2.

              --ignore-eol
                     Added in version 3.14.

                     The  option  implies  line-wise  comparison  and  ignores
                     LF/CRLF differences.

       copy <file>... <destination>, copy -t <destination> <file>...
              Copy files to <destination> (either file or directory).  If mul‐
              tiple files are specified, or if -t is specified, the  <destina‐
              tion>  must  be directory and it must exist. If -t is not speci‐
              fied, the last argument is  assumed  to  be  the  <destination>.
              Wildcards  are  not  supported.  copy does follow symlinks. That
              means it does not copy symlinks, but the files or directories it
              point to.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input files.

              Added in version 3.26: Support for -t argument.

       copy_directory <dir>... <destination>
              Copy content of <dir>... directories to <destination> directory.
              If <destination> directory does not exist it  will  be  created.
              copy_directory does follow symlinks.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input directories.

              Added in version 3.15: The command now fails when the source di‐
              rectory  does not exist.  Previously it succeeded by creating an
              empty destination directory.

       copy_directory_if_different <dir>... <destination>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Copy changed content of <dir>...  directories  to  <destination>
              directory.  If <destination> directory does not exist it will be
              created.

              copy_directory_if_different  does  follow symlinks.  The command
              fails when the source directory does not exist.

       copy_if_different <file>... <destination>
              Copy files to <destination> (either file or directory)  if  they
              have  changed.   If  multiple files are specified, the <destina‐
              tion> must be directory and it  must  exist.   copy_if_different
              does follow symlinks.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input files.

       create_symlink <old> <new>
              Create a symbolic link <new> naming <old>.

              Added in version 3.13: Support for creating symlinks on Windows.

              NOTE:
                 Path  to where <new> symbolic link will be created has to ex‐
                 ist beforehand.

       create_hardlink <old> <new>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Create a hard link <new> naming <old>.

              NOTE:
                 Path to where <new> hard link will be created  has  to  exist
                 beforehand.  <old> has to exist beforehand.

       echo [<string>...]
              Displays arguments as text.

       echo_append [<string>...]
              Displays arguments as text but no new line.

       env [<options>] [--] <command> [<arg>...]
              Added in version 3.1.

              Run command in a modified environment. Options are:

              ## NAME=VALUE
                     Replaces the current value of ## NAME with VALUE.

              --unset=## NAME
                     Unsets the current value of ## NAME.

              --modify ## ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION
                     Added in version 3.25.

                     Apply  a single ## ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION operation to the
                     modified environment.

                     The ## NAME=VALUE and --unset=NAME options are equivalent to
                     --modify ## NAME=set:VALUE and --modify NAME=unset:, respec‐
                     tively.  Note that --modify ## NAME=reset:  resets  NAME  to
                     the  value it had when cmake launched (or unsets it), not
                     to the most recent ## NAME=VALUE option.

              --     Added in version 3.24.

                     Added support for the double dash argument --. Use --  to
                     stop interpreting options/environment variables and treat
                     the next argument as the command, even if it start with -
                     or contains a =.

       environment
              Display the current environment variables.

       false  Added in version 3.16.

              Do nothing, with an exit code of 1.

       make_directory <dir>...
              Create  <dir> directories.  If necessary, create parent directo‐
              ries too.  If a directory already exists it will be silently ig‐
              nored.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input directories.

       md5sum <file>...
              Create MD5 checksum of files in md5sum compatible format:

                 351abe79cd3800b38cdfb25d45015a15  file1.txt
                 052f86c15bbde68af55c7f7b340ab639  file2.txt

       sha1sum <file>...
              Added in version 3.10.

              Create SHA1 checksum of files in sha1sum compatible format:

                 4bb7932a29e6f73c97bb9272f2bdc393122f86e0  file1.txt

       sha224sum <file>...
              Added in version 3.10.

              Create SHA224 checksum of files in sha224sum compatible format:

                 b9b9346bc8437bbda630b0b7ddfc5ea9ca157546dbbf4c613192f930  file1.txt

       sha256sum <file>...
              Added in version 3.10.

              Create SHA256 checksum of files in sha256sum compatible format:

                 76713b23615d31680afeb0e9efe94d47d3d4229191198bb46d7485f9cb191acc  file1.txt

       remove [-f] <file>...
              Deprecated since version 3.17.

              Remove the file(s). The planned behavior was that if any of  the
              listed  files  already  do  not  exist,  the  command  returns a
              non-zero exit code, but no message  is  logged.  The  -f  option
              changes  the  behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success)
              in such situations instead.  remove does  not  follow  symlinks.
              That means it remove only symlinks and not files it point to.

              The implementation was buggy and always returned 0. It cannot be
              fixed without breaking backwards compatibility. Use rm instead.

       remove_directory <dir>...
              Deprecated since version 3.17.

              Remove <dir> directories and their contents. If a directory does
              not exist it will be silently ignored.  Use rm instead.

              Added in version 3.15: Support for multiple directories.

              Added  in  version  3.16:  If <dir> is a symlink to a directory,
              just the symlink will be removed.

       rename <oldname> <newname>
              Rename a file or directory (on one volume).  If  file  with  the
              <newname>  name  already  exists,  then  it will be silently re‐
              placed.

       rm [-rRf] [--] <file|dir>...
              Added in version 3.17.

              Remove the files <file> or directories <dir>.  Use -r or  -R  to
              remove  directories  and  their contents recursively.  If any of
              the listed files/directories do not exist, the command returns a
              non-zero exit code, but no message  is  logged.  The  -f  option
              changes  the  behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success)
              in such situations instead. Use -- to stop interpreting  options
              and  treat  all remaining arguments as paths, even if they start
              with -.

       sleep <number>
              Added in version 3.0.

              Sleep for <number> seconds. <number> may  be  a  floating  point
              number.   A  practical minimum is about 0.1 seconds due to over‐
              head in starting/stopping CMake executable. This can  be  useful
              in a CMake script to insert a delay:

                 # Sleep for about 0.5 seconds

       tar [cxt][vf][zjJ] file.tar [<options>] [--] [<pathname>...]
              Create or extract a tar or zip archive.  Options are:

              c      Create  a new archive containing the specified files.  If
                     used, the <pathname>... argument is mandatory.

              x      Extract to disk from the archive.

                     Added in version 3.15: The <pathname>...  argument  could
                     be  used  to  extract only selected files or directories.
                     When extracting selected files or directories,  you  must
                     provide  their exact names including the path, as printed
                     by list (-t).

              t      List archive contents.

                     Added in version 3.15: The <pathname>...  argument  could
                     be used to list only selected files or directories.

              v      Produce verbose output.

              z      Compress the resulting archive with gzip.

              j      Compress the resulting archive with bzip2.

              J      Added in version 3.1.

                     Compress the resulting archive with XZ.

              --zstd Added in version 3.15.

                     Compress the resulting archive with Zstandard.

              --files-from=<file>
                     Added in version 3.1.

                     Read file names from the given file, one per line.  Blank
                     lines  are  ignored.  Lines may not start in - except for
                     --add-file=<name> to add files whose names start in -.

              --format=<format>
                     Added in version 3.3.

                     Specify the format of the archive to  be  created.   Sup‐
                     ported  formats  are: 7zip, gnutar, pax, paxr (restricted
                     pax, default), and zip.

              --mtime=<date>
                     Added in version 3.1.

                     Specify modification time recorded in tarball entries.

              --touch
                     Added in version 3.24.

                     Use current local timestamp instead  of  extracting  file
                     timestamps from the archive.

              --     Added in version 3.1.

                     Stop  interpreting  options and treat all remaining argu‐
                     ments as file names, even if they start with -.

              Added in version 3.1: LZMA (7zip) support.

              Added in version 3.15: The command now continues adding files to
              an archive even if some of the files are not readable.  This be‐
              havior is more consistent with the classic tar tool. The command
              now also parses all flags, and if an invalid flag was  provided,
              a warning is issued.

       time <command> [<args>...]
              Run  <command>  and  display elapsed time (including overhead of
              CMake frontend).

              Added in version 3.5: The command now properly passes  arguments
              with  spaces or special characters through to the child process.
              This may break scripts that worked around the bug with their own
              extra quoting or escaping.

       touch <file>...
              Creates <file> if file do not exist.  If <file>  exists,  it  is
              changing <file> access and modification times.

       touch_nocreate <file>...
              Touch  a file if it exists but do not create it.  If a file does
              not exist it will be silently ignored.

       true   Added in version 3.16.

              Do nothing, with an exit code of 0.

   Windows-specific Command-Line Tools
       The following cmake -E commands are available only on Windows:

       delete_regv <key>
              Delete Windows registry value.

       env_vs8_wince <sdkname>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Displays a batch file which sets the environment  for  the  pro‐
              vided Windows CE SDK installed in VS2005.

       env_vs9_wince <sdkname>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Displays  a  batch  file which sets the environment for the pro‐
              vided Windows CE SDK installed in VS2008.

       write_regv <key> <value>
              Write Windows registry value.

RUN THE FIND-PACKAGE TOOL
       CMake provides a pkg-config like helper for Makefile-based projects:

          cmake --find-package [<options>]

       It searches a package using find_package()  and  prints  the  resulting
       flags  to  stdout.   This can be used instead of pkg-config to find in‐
       stalled libraries in plain Makefile-based projects or in autoconf-based
       projects (via share/aclocal/cmake.m4).

       NOTE:
          This mode is not well-supported due to some  technical  limitations.
          It is kept for compatibility but should not be used in new projects.

RUN A WORKFLOW PRESET
       Added in version 3.25.

       CMake Presets provides a way to execute multiple build steps in order:

          cmake --workflow <options>

       The options are:

       --workflow
              Select a Workflow Preset using one of the following options.

       --preset <preset>, --preset=<preset>
              Use  a workflow preset to specify a workflow. The project binary
              directory is inferred from the  initial  configure  preset.  The
              current  working directory must contain CMake preset files.  See
              preset for more details.

              Changed in version 3.31: When following  immediately  after  the
              --workflow option, the --preset argument can be omitted and just
              the <preset> name can be given.  This means the following syntax
              is valid:

                 $ cmake --workflow my-preset

       --list-presets
              Lists the available workflow presets. The current working direc‐
              tory must contain CMake preset files.

       --fresh
              Perform  a  fresh configuration of the build tree, which has the
              same effect as cmake --fresh.

VIEW HELP
       To print selected pages from the CMake documentation, use

          cmake --help[-<topic>]

       with one of the following options:

       -version [<file>], --version [<file>], /V [<file>]
              Show program  name/version  banner  and  exit.   The  output  is
